# PublishingHouse_Automation
This project is about updating price of books in an automatic way.

Problem:
Publishing house has a web site, which has 767 books in it. Every time they update the price of books from excel, they need to update every price in the web site and it takes huge amount of time. 

So, I design a program that takes an Excel file -which includes book names, new prices and other stuff- as an input, then updates the prices on the web site automaticly. 

I used mainly selenium, beautiful soup, pandas, numpy, difflib libraries in python.
